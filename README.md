# Flower_AI
TensorFlow model that classifies five different flowers.

Welcome to my Flower AI repository!
This model is trained to classify images of five different flowers - roses, daisies, dandelions, sunflowers, and tulips.
The model utlizes a dataset consisting of about 13,000 images from Kaggle.

The TensorFlow model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with six Convoltutional layers, six Max Pooling layers,
and six Dense layers. It is trained for 150 epochs with a validation dataset that is 10% split from the training dataset.
